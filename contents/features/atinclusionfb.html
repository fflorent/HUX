<h1>At Inclusion Fallback</h1>
<p>At Inclusion Fallback is a module that converts anchor links with <a href="@+feature=contents/features/atinclusion.html">At Inclusions</a> to links with <a href="@+feature=contents/features/hashbang.html">Hash Bangs</a> when At Inclusion is not supported.</p>
<p>That is very practical to ensure that the website is indexed thanks to At Inclusion, but also that it is usable by browsers that do not implement history states yet.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>That module requires <a href="@+feature=contents/features/atinclusion.html">At Inclusion</a> <b>and</b> <a href="@+feature=contents/features/hashbang.html">Hash Bang</a></p>
