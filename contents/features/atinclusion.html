<h1>At Inclusion</h1>
<p class="warning">Warning : At Inclusion requires Firefox 4+, Chrome 5+, Opera 11.50+, and Safari5+
		<br/>To support other browsers/versions, you are recommended to use <a href="@+feature=contents/features/atinclusionfb.html">At Inclusion Fallback</a></p>
<p class="warning">This module is still experimental. See <a href="#known_bugs">known bugs</a></p>
<p>At Inclusion is a module for HUX that manages history and updates URL as the user loads contents.</p>
<p>By updating URL, At Inclusion ensures that the loaded contents are retrieved when the page is refreshed, or if the URL is shared with someone else.</p>
<p>By managing history, At Inclusion lets the user click on "Back"/"Next" button of their browser to navigate through the history.</p>
<h2><a name="differences_with_hash_bang"></a>Differences with Hash Bang</h2>
<p>At Inclusion uses the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history#Adding_and_modifying_history_entries" target="_blank">last history API (pushstate, replacestate)</a> available for Chrome 5+, Firefox 4+, Internet Explorer 10+, Opera 11.5+ and Safari 5.0+</p>
<p>For the older browsers, you are proposed to use <a href="@+feature=contents/features/hashmgr.html">Hash Bang</a> coupled with <a href="@+feature=contents/features/atinclusionfb.html">AtInclusions fallback</a></p>

<p>We can consider the fact that letting the user load contents in any target as a security issue, even though that contents are provided by HTML pages hosted in the same server.</p>
<p>Until a solution is provided, you are recommended not to use <a href="@+feature=contents/features/hashmgr.html">Hash Bang</a> nor <a href="@+feature=contents/features/atinclusion.html">At Inclusion</a> except for test purposes 
	and with pages hosted by a test server.</p>
