<h1>Hash Manager</h1>
<p class="note">NOTE : If you want to index your website, you are recommended to use <a href="@+feature=contents/features/atinclusion.html">At Inclusion</a> instead</p>
<p>Hash Bang is a module for HUX that manages history and updates URL as the user loads contents.</p>
<p>By updating URL, Hash Bang ensures that the loaded contents are retrieved when the page is refreshed, or if the URL is shared with someone else.</p>
<p>By managing history, Hash Bang lets the user click on "Back"/"Next" button of their browser to navigate through the history.</p>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<p>While <a href="@+feature=contents/features/atinclusion.html">At Inclusion</a> only works with some browsers, Hash Bang works with a majority of browsers (including Internet Explorer since version 7).</p>
<p>That is the reason why <a href="@+feature=contents/features/atinclusionfb.html">At Inclusion Fallback</a> converts links with At Inclusion to links with Hash Bangs.</p>
<p>So, in any case, you are advised to use At Inclusion with At Inclusion Fallback if needed.</p>
